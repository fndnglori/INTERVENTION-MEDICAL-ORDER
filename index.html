            <p>Medical orders are formal instructions issued by qualified healthcare providers, such as physicians, nurse practitioners, or physician assistants, detailing the care and treatment a patient should receive. These orders are fundamental to patient management and are legally binding documents that guide the clinical actions of the entire healthcare team, especially nurses.</p>
            <p>They ensure a standardized approach to patient care, promote safety, and facilitate effective communication among healthcare professionals. Adherence to these orders is critical for legal compliance and optimal patient outcomes.</p>
            <p><strong>Common Examples of Medical Orders:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Medication Prescriptions:</strong> Instructions for administering pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, pain relievers, and chronic disease medications (e.g., "Administer Amoxicillin 250mg PO every 8 hours for 7 days").</li>
                <li><strong>Diagnostic Tests:</strong> Directives for laboratory tests (e.g., blood work, urine analysis) or imaging studies (e.g., X-rays, MRI, CT scans) to aid in diagnosis and monitoring (e.g., "Order CBC with differential stat").</li>
