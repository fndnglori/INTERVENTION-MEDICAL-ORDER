            <h2>Types of Medical Orders</h2>
            <p>Medical orders are categorized based on their duration, urgency, and specific conditions under which they are to be carried out. Understanding these types is crucial for accurate and timely patient care.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Routine Order:</strong>
                    <p>These orders are standard, ongoing directives that continue until they are explicitly changed or superseded by a new order. They form the backbone of a patient's long-term care plan. Examples include daily medications, routine vital sign monitoring, or a specific diet that remains constant throughout the patient's stay.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>PRN Order ("Pro Re Nata"):</strong>
                    <p>PRN, Latin for "as needed," orders are given to be administered based on the patient's symptoms or requests, rather than on a fixed schedule. The nurse assesses the patient's condition and determines if the medication or intervention is appropriate according to the order's parameters. Common examples include pain medication, anti-nausea drugs, or sleep aids.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Standing Order:</strong>
                    <p>Standing orders are pre-approved protocols or sets of instructions that allow nurses or other healthcare professionals to initiate specific treatments or interventions under defined conditions without needing to consult the physician for each individual instance. These are often used for common patient conditions or in emergency situations to ensure prompt care. They must be signed and approved by a physician or authorized prescriber.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>One-Time Order:</strong>
                    <p>A one-time order is an instruction for a medication or treatment to be given only once at a specific time or within a specific timeframe. After the administration, the order is considered complete and is not to be repeated unless a new order is issued. An example might be a single dose of a sedative before a procedure or a specific vaccination.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>STAT Order ("Statim"):</strong>
                    <p>STAT, Latin for "immediately," orders are urgent, one-time directives that require immediate administration due to an emergent or life-threatening situation. These orders take precedence over all other non-emergent orders and must be carried out without delay. For example, a STAT order for epinephrine in an anaphylactic reaction.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Now Order:</strong>
                    <p>Similar to a STAT order in urgency, but slightly less critical. A "Now" order indicates that the medication or treatment should be administered within a short timeframe, typically within 90 minutes, but not necessarily "immediately" like a STAT order. It's used for situations requiring prompt but not immediate action.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
